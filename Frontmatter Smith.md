My plugin used to help entering often used metadata in the frontmatter.

Official URL: [Frontmatter Smith](https://github.com/stroiman/obsidian-frontmatter-smith)

## Installing

This plugin is not yet available in the community plugin list. The best option is to use [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat), a plugin that allows installing other plugins.

Once you have enabled BRAT, go to its settings, click "Add new plugin", and use "https://github.com/stroiman/obsidian-frontmatter-smith"

You can also install it manually, but you're on your own if you choose to do so.
