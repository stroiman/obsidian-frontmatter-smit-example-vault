The following plugins are used in this vault

## Daily Notes (core plugin)

One of the main use cases of [[Frontmatter Smith]] is to help record common data you want to track on a daily basis. One of my personal goals was to track the kinds of ADHD medicine I was using; and using other mechanisms to see how it correlates with my behavioural patterns.

So _a_ daily notes plugin is useful for demonstrating this use case, and the core plugin is sufficient for this demo.

## BRAT

BRAT is a plugin that allows installing other plugins that are not yet available in the official community plugin list. _Frontmatter Smith_ is not yet available, that's why BRAT is used.

## Dataview (with JavaScript enabled)

This is used how the more complex data can be queried, and displayed easily.

JavaScript queries are used to transform data in the query (I think you can do this with DQL, but it was easier for me with JS. If you know how to convert the JS to DQL, [I'd like to know](https://github.com/stroiman/obsidian-frontmatter-smit-example-vault/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen))

## Calendar

Used to help entering example data
